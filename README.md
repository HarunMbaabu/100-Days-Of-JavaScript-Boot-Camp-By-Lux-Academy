<h2> Running the code:</h2>

<p> To run the code you need NodeJS</P>
<P> <B> Node.js </b> is a run-time environment which includes everything you need to execute a program written in JavaScript. It’s used for running scripts on the server to render content before it is delivered to a web browser. 
</p>
<p>
  NPM stands for Node Package Manager, which is an application and repository for developing and sharing JavaScript code.
</p>
<p> <b>
  This guide will help you install and update Node.js and NPM on a Windows system and other useful Node.js commands.
</b> </p>

<h3> Step 1: Download Node.js Installer </h3>
<hr>

<p> Visit NodeJS official webpage https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download installer acording to your system </p>

<hr><h3>Step 2: Install Node.js and NPM from Browser </h3> </hr>
<p>
1. Once the installer finishes downloading, launch it. Open the downloads link in your browser and click the file. Or, browse to the location where you have saved the file and double-click it to launch.
</p>


<p>
2. The system will ask if you want to run the software – click Run.
</p>

3. You will be welcomed to the Node.js Setup Wizard – click Next.</p>
<p>
4. On the next screen, review the license agreement. Click Next if you agree to the terms and install the software.</p>
