JavaScript is a programming language or, in other words, a means by which a computer is instructed to do things. Just the same as one controls humans with hisses and meows, one controls computers with statements written in a programming language.

All web browsers understand JavaScript and you can take advantage of that to make web pages do crazy things! JavaScript started as a way to make web pages more interactive. 

> Nowadays JavaScript runs in more places than just web browsers, it runs on web servers, phones and even robots! **This repository will teach you some JavaScript basics so that you can get up and running in no time**.

<h2> Running the code:</h2>

<p> To run the code you need NodeJS</P>
<P> <B> Node.js </b> is a run-time environment which includes everything you need to execute a program written in JavaScript. It’s used for running scripts on the server to render content before it is delivered to a web browser. 
</p>
<p>
  NPM stands for Node Package Manager, which is an application and repository for developing and sharing JavaScript code.
</p>
<p> <b>
  This guide will help you install and update Node.js and NPM on a Windows system and other useful Node.js commands.
</b> </p>  
  <hr>
<h3> Step 1: Download Node.js Installer </h3>
<hr>

<p> Visit NodeJS official webpage https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and download installer acording to your system </p>

<hr><h3>Step 2: Install Node.js and NPM from Browser </h3> </hr>
<p>
1. Once the installer finishes downloading, launch it. Open the downloads link in your browser and click the file. Or, browse to the location where you have saved the file and double-click it to launch.
</p>


<p>
2. The system will ask if you want to run the software – click Run.
</p>
<p>
3. You will be welcomed to the Node.js Setup Wizard – click Next.</p>
<p>
4. On the next screen, review the license agreement. Click Next if you agree to the terms and install the software.</p>
<p>
5. The installer will prompt you for the installation location. Leave the default location, unless you have a specific need to install it somewhere else – then click Next.</p>
<p>
6. The wizard will let you select components to include or remove from the installation. Again, unless you have a specific need, accept the defaults by clicking Next.</p>
<p>
7. Finally, click the Install button to run the installer. When it finishes, click Finish. </p>
